## Python Basics

### Task 1: Generating a Geometric Progression

**Purpose**: To generate the first N terms of a geometric progression with a given first term `a` and common ratio `r`, without directly using the formula for the product.

**Analysis**:

- Utilize the relation \( a_n = a \times r^n \) to compute each term.
- Use NumPy functions to create an array of exponents from 0 to N-1.
- Multiply the initial term `a` by `r` raised to the power of the exponents array.

**Outcome**: Successfully generated the first N terms of the geometric progression.

---

### Task 2: Palindrome Number Checker

**Purpose**: To check whether a given integer `N` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.

**Analysis**:

- Convert the integer to a string.
- Compare the string to its reverse using slicing.
- Return `True` if the number is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.

**Outcome**: Correctly identified palindrome and non-palindrome numbers in the provided test cases.

- Identify NaN positions using `np.isnan`.
- Replace NaNs with the computed median.

**Outcome**: All missing values were replaced, resulting in an array without NaNs.

---

### Task 6: Computing Mean Values for Image Channels

**Purpose**: To compute the mean values for each of the three color channels in an image represented as a 3D NumPy array of shape (n, m, 3).

**Analysis**:

- Use `np.mean` over the first two axes (height and width).
- This computes the mean for each channel across all pixels.

**Outcome**: Obtained a vector containing the mean of each channel.

---

### Task 7: Extracting Unique Vertical Layers from a 3D Matrix

**Purpose**: To extract all unique vertical layers (along the first axis) from a 3D matrix.

**Analysis**:

- Reshape the 3D matrix to a 2D array where each row represents a layer.
- Use `np.unique` with `axis=0` to find unique layers.
- Retrieve and reshape the unique layers back to their original dimensions.

**Outcome**: Extracted and presented the unique vertical layers from the matrix.

### Task 4: Correlation Between Class and Fare

**Purpose**: To determine the correlation between passenger class and ticket fare, and to visualize fare distribution by embarkation port.

**Analysis**:

- **Correlation Coefficient**: Calculated a Pearson correlation of -0.5495 between `Pclass` and `Fare`.
- **Interpretation**: Negative correlation indicates that higher classes (lower `Pclass` value) are associated with higher fares.
- **Mean Fare by Port**:

  - Violin plots displaying fare distributions for each embarkation port.

**Conclusions**:

- Passengers in higher classes paid more for their tickets.
- Cherbourg had higher average fares, suggesting more first-class passengers embarked there.

- **Findings**:
  - **Cherbourg (C)**: Higher median fares and greater variability; associated with wealthier passengers.
  - **Southampton (S)**: Moderate fares with a wider range; mixed passenger classes.
  - **Queenstown (Q)**: Lower fares; predominantly third-class passengers.

**Conclusions**:

- The embarkation port is indicative of the socio-economic status of passengers.

  - Mean age of females: 27.92 years.

**Conclusions**:

- Younger passengers had a higher survival rate.
- Females were generally younger than males.
- Age and gender were significant factors in survival, possibly due to evacuation protocols prioritizing women and children.
